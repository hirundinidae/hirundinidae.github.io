      <h1>Hi!</h1>
      <p>I'm Diana. My hobbies include kickboxing, increasing my typing speed, and running. </p>
      <h3>Kickboxing</h3>
      <p> As an amateur kick boxer, I've competed at the provincial and national level
        with my club, Hook Up Muay Thai, being trained by my coaches, Theodora Pistiolis
        and Dagmar Grasser. Since I joined in the fall of 2017, kickboxing has become an
        integral part of my life. Kickboxing has allowed me to connect with other
        competitors and members of the community. At my gym, I currently assist other
        coaches with younger athletes aged 4-12. Presently, I'm taking a coaching course
        with WAKO Canada to be able to coach on my own. </p>
