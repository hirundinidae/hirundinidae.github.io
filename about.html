      <h1>Hi!</h1>
      <p>I'm Diana. My hobbies include kickboxing, increasing my typing speed, and running. According to online personality tests I've taken, my personality type is ESFJ. </p>
      <p>
        <pre>
      </pre>As an amateur kick boxer, I've competed at the provincial and national level with my club, Hook Up Muay Thai, being trained by my coaches, Theodora Pistiolis and Dagmar Grasser. Since I joined in the fall of 2017, kickboxing has become an
        integral part of my life. Kickboxing has allowed me to connect with other competitors and members of the community.
